# POD E-Learning App

## Installation

For development:

1. Clone Repo
2. Change Directory to the App root folder and execute npm install. This will install Backend dependencies.
3. Once completed, create a .env.dev file with the following information:

```
APP_ENV=development
APP_NAME=POD E-Learning
DB_HOST= --your mysql host--
DB_USER= --your mysql user--
DB_PASS= --your mysql pass--
DB_NAME=POD_DB
SECRET= -- add a secret keyword for JasonWebToken --
EMAIL_PASS= -- Contact Repo Admin to get a testing password --
```

4. Create POD DB database.
5. Change Directory to /client. Client contains frontend react app.
6. Run npm install inside client to get frontend dependencies.
7. In development, both the express backend and the react frontend have to be started to run the full app. In the app root folder, execute npm start (or npm run dev to use nodemon).
8. Then in another terminal, move to the client folder and execute npm start.
9. Browse the app.
